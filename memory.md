### 2025-12-14 14:23 - Established Go parity plan with detailed beads backlog referencing Node repo. Epic mmm-1 now encodes execution order; each task notes to consult epic; P1 audit (mmm-14) blocks epic.
### 2025-12-14 15:03 - bd --no-db ignores blockers in ready output; rely on issue dependencies/epic order instead of ready list until DB bug fixed.
### 2025-12-14 15:27 - New session kicked off; need to identify next beads issue for Go port despite ready cmd bug—cross-reference epic ordering before picking work.
### 2025-12-14 15:37 - Completed mmm-14 audit; logged gaps for config schema (mmm-18), Makefile (mmm-19), locale detection (mmm-20), HTTP retry leaks (mmm-21), init TUI networking (mmm-22), and environment metadata (mmm-23). Prioritize these before jumping into parity work.
### 2025-12-14 15:49 - mmm-18 fixed: ModsJson.mods now uses []models.Mod (config entries) instead of lock-style ModInstall; default config seeded with []models.Mod. README updated to reflect per-mod allowVersionFallback (no global flag).
### 2025-12-14 16:01 - mcp beads ready/list endpoints crash when dependencies metadata incomplete; inspect .beads/issues.jsonl directly until schema bug fixed.
### 2025-12-14 16:03 - CLI bd --no-db ready works; API-only failure scoped to MCP. Use CLI for ready list until fix.
### 2025-12-14 16:21 - mmm-23 now active; release prepare script rewrites internal/environment.go placeholders (version + API keys + HELP_URL) but Go build still hardcodes REPL_* defaults—need ldflags-driven versioning + env helpers wired into CLI/help output.
### 2025-12-14 16:30 - Wired HELP_URL helper + Cobra help footer mirroring Node CLI; ended up keeping helper as placeholder-only (no runtime env lookup) because release scripts still replace REPL_* directly; tests cover footer contains REPL_HELP_URL.
### 2025-12-14 17:08 - Ready list reviewed; plan to tackle mmm-21 (retry body leak) next since it's the lone P1 bug blocking network stability work.
### 2025-12-14 17:12 - mmm-21 resolved via `drainAndClose` helper + regression test checking retry responses are drained/closed; remembered to cover nil bodies to keep coverage at 100%.
### 2025-12-14 17:27 - Ready queue now elevates mmm-17 (telemetry lifecycle redesign) as sole P1; plan to tackle it next before moving on to CLI/global flag work.
### 2025-12-14 17:37 - Reworking telemetry lifecycle for mmm-17: introduce Init/Capture/Shutdown APIs with session-scoped PostHog client, signal-driven flushing in `main.go`, and new `MMM_DISABLE_TELEMETRY` opt-out plus docs/telemetry.md for future TUI guidance.
### 2025-12-14 17:48 - Added shared `internal/lifecycle` signal manager so telemetry (and future subsystems) register handlers once; `main.go` now triggers lifecycle instead of calling telemetry directly.
### 2025-12-14 18:06 - Explicit reminder: must adhere to provided instructions and guidelines perfectly.
### 2025-12-14 19:05 - Reinforced: instructions are absolute (no edits to historical docs, keep user-facing docs simple) and must be followed without improvisation; refer to memory before every action.
### 2025-12-14 20:29 - Pulled latest Engineer/Beads/LongTermMemory/ADR/Golang guidance; `bd --no-db ready --json` shows open work including Makefile portability (mmm-19), locale detection bug (mmm-20), and init TUI minecraft client injection/offline flow (mmm-22), plus epic-ordered parity tasks starting at mmm-2.
### 2025-12-14 20:33 - Verified mmm-19 is a real issue on Unix shells: `make build` produces host-compiled binaries for darwin/windows outputs because `@set GOOS=...` doesn’t export env vars in sh; `od -N 4` shows all artifacts start with `7f 45 4c 46` (ELF), including `build/windows/mmm.exe`. Note: current `run` target is `go run .` so the issue description’s old run-path claim appears stale.
### 2025-12-14 20:38 - mmm-19 closed after fixing Makefile cross-platform build env handling and confirming artifacts; user verified on Windows as well.
### 2025-12-14 20:43 - Follow-up: Windows `make build` can fail when cross-compiling linux/darwin due to CGO defaulting on (runtime/cgo errors without a cross C toolchain). Updated Makefile to disable CGO for cross builds by default via CROSS_CGO_ENABLED?=0 and per-target CGO_ENABLED export; tracked as mmm-24 (in progress pending user re-verify on Windows).
### 2025-12-14 20:44 - mmm-24 closed after user confirmed `make build` succeeds cleanly on Windows with CGO disabled for cross builds by default.
### 2025-12-14 20:45 - Next planned work: start epic mmm-1 execution order at mmm-2 (global flags/config helpers) now that build/test/coverage gates and telemetry lifecycle are in place.
### 2025-12-14 21:04 - TS reference (/tmp/mmm) uses commander with global options: `-c, --config <MODLIST_JSON>` default `./modlist.json`; `-q, --quiet` suppresses output and forces non-interactive behavior by erroring instead of prompting in interactions; `-d, --debug` enables debug logging. Logger behavior: `log()` prints if not quiet OR forceShow OR debug; `debug()` prints only when debug; errors use commander `program.error(..., exitCode)`. Go mmm-2 should mirror semantics without introducing runtime/context or store proxies; define persistent flags on root and let subcommands read flags via Cobra.
### 2025-12-14 21:12 - Implemented mmm-2 per KISS: root Cobra now defines -c/--config, -q/--quiet, -d/--debug directly; removed runtime/context injection and store proxy; added internal/logger with TS-like quiet/debug semantics; added internal/config SaveConfiguration/SaveLockFile helpers; updated Makefile `test` to `go test ./...` while keeping coverage gating on internal; verification passed (make test / make coverage-enforce / make build).
### 2025-12-14 21:28 - Refactored internal/config into a cohesive module: introduced config.Metadata (config path + derived lock/mods-folder paths) and split responsibilities across defaults/io/lock/metadata files; removed earlier save.go/config.go legacy entrypoints. Verified `make test`, `make coverage-enforce` (100%), `make build`.
### 2025-12-14 21:31 - Tweaked naming to be domain-first: renamed io.go/io_test.go to config.go/config_test.go (lock.go remains lock-focused). Verified `make test`, `make coverage-enforce` (100%), `make build`.
### 2025-12-14 21:37 - User direction: default loader should be Fabric for now; gameVersion default ideally resolves to latest Minecraft version (but should live in init flow, with offline fallback). Created mmm-25 to remove hard-coded defaults and rely on init/user input long-term; updated DefaultConfig loader to Fabric.
### 2025-12-14 21:44 - Wired minecraft.GetLatestVersion into config init (InitConfig now accepts a minecraft Doer and uses it to seed GameVersion). Added minecraft.ClearManifestCache and test coverage to manage manifest caching deterministically in tests; all make targets still green with 100% coverage.
### 2025-12-14 21:46 - Removed nil-guards for required dependencies (minecraft client in config.InitConfig) to reduce cyclomatic complexity; treat Doer as mandatory and keep behavior deterministic via ClearManifestCache in tests.
### 2025-12-14 21:51 - Removed DefaultConfig() (avoid shared defaults helper); InitConfig now inlines temporary defaults and sets gameVersion via minecraft.GetLatestVersion with explicit fallback. Tests now use explicit literals instead of reusing values from code under test.
### 2025-12-14 21:54 - User clarified: no default gameVersion is allowed. Updated config.InitConfig to require minecraft.GetLatestVersion (error if unavailable/empty); tests updated; 100% coverage preserved.
### 2025-12-14 21:56 - Further refinement: InitConfig now fetches latest version before constructing config (fail-fast), avoiding any post-construction mutation of GameVersion.
### 2025-12-14 21:58 - Per user direction, removed latest==\"\" guard in InitConfig to reduce cyclomatic complexity; treat nil error from GetLatestVersion as always yielding a valid latest release. Kept fail-fast behavior on errors; tests updated.
### 2025-12-14 22:18 - Simplified internal/config further by making afero.Fs a required param for config/lock functions (removed variadic filesystem args and InitFilesystem-style fallback), reducing defensive branching since this is a single application.
### 2025-12-14 22:24 - Fixed Windows behavior for config.Metadata.ModsFolderPath: treat paths starting with `/` or `\\` as rooted/absolute so they aren’t incorrectly joined under the config directory; tests/coverage still green.
### 2025-12-14 22:27 - Added Windows-only metadata test to cover drive-letter absolute paths, plus a rooted forward-slash test, to keep 100% coverage on Windows for ModsFolderPath absolute detection.
### 2025-12-14 22:28 - Closed mmm-2 after implementing Cobra global flags, logger abstraction, and cohesive config module refactor with strict latest-version init and cross-platform path handling; all verification targets passing with 100% coverage.
### 2025-12-14 22:51 - Checked `bd --no-db ready --json`; no P0/P1 items surfaced. Next work per epic mmm-1 execution order is mmm-3 (finish `init` command with persistence + quiet-mode semantics). Consider quick-drive-by bugfix mmm-20 (locale detection empty strings) if we want a small warm-up change before the larger init persistence work.
### 2025-12-14 22:54 - Claimed mmm-3 and started reviewing `docs/commands/init.md` + current Go init TUI. Noted: current TUI only covers loader/game-version, doesn’t persist config/lock, and `gameVersion` model uses `http.DefaultClient` directly; Node reference repo at `/tmp/mmm` is currently missing and must be cloned per epic before finalizing behavior parity.
### 2025-12-14 22:59 - Per user request, split Bubble Tea init interaction work out of mmm-3; created new ticket `mmm-1.1` (“Init command: Bubble Tea interactive flow”) as a child of epic `mmm-1`, discovered-from `mmm-3`.
### 2025-12-14 23:00 - Alignment for mmm-3: implement init as flags-only for now; if any required init flags are missing, error with guidance to provide `-l/-g/-r/-m` (no stdin prompts, no TUI). Interactive flow deferred to mmm-1.1; recorded in mmm-3 notes.
### 2025-12-15 11:20 - Session resumed after disruption. Repo state: branch `go` ahead by 18 commits, with local modifications only to `.beads/issues.jsonl` + `memory.md`. Next pickup remains `mmm-3` (in_progress): implement non-TUI, flags-only `init` persistence/overwrite + --quiet semantics; Node reference repo may need recloning at `/tmp/mmm` before parity checks.
### 2025-12-15 11:28 - Started implementing mmm-3: switched `cmd/mmm/init` from Bubble Tea Run to non-TUI `RunE` that requires `-l/-g/-r/-m`, validates loader/release-types/mods-folder + Minecraft version, and writes `modlist.json` + empty lock file (overwrite prompt gated by --quiet).
### 2025-12-15 11:31 - mmm-3 progress: added cmd-level unit tests for init persistence + overwrite/new-path behaviors; updated `docs/commands/init.md` to reflect current flags-only Go behavior; verified `go fmt ./...`, `make test`, `make coverage-enforce` (100%), and `make build`; cloned Node reference repo to `/tmp/mmm` for parity checks.
### 2025-12-15 11:41 - Refined mmm-3 init implementation to be more Cobra-native: swapped loader/release-types to typed pflag values (VarP) so validation happens during flag parsing, added shell completions, and removed manual flag-get helpers. Kept flags non-required to support future TUI supplying missing values; init still errors with a single message when required init inputs are missing in non-interactive mode.
### 2025-12-15 11:44 - User clarified init defaults: only loader is required; gameVersion defaults to latest via minecraft module, allowed release types default to [release], and mods folder defaults to "mods". This supersedes earlier "no default gameVersion" direction.
### 2025-12-15 11:48 - Implemented init defaults in Cobra flag declarations: `--game-version` defaults to `latest` (resolved via minecraft module at runtime), `--release-types` defaults to `release`, and `--mods-folder` defaults to `mods`; init now only requires `--loader`.
### 2025-12-15 11:51 - Created Beads issue `mmm-26` to decide/implement desired behavior when the mods folder path does not exist (create vs prompt vs error; quiet semantics; keep path resolution consistent). Linked as discovered-from `mmm-3`.
### 2025-12-15 11:57 - Updated `docs/commands/init.md` to comply with new user-facing documentation guidelines: removed future-facing notes and rewrote in second person to reflect current init behavior and defaults.
### 2025-12-15 11:58 - User feedback: current `docs/commands/init.md` style/content is not landing; compare against Node README init section and align tone/structure where appropriate.
### 2025-12-15 12:04 - Updated `docs/commands/init.md` to match the new conversational user-doc tone guidelines: example-first, short paragraphs, and a flags table; removed spec-style sections.
### 2025-12-15 12:05 - Doc tweak: removed `-c/--config` from the `init` example command since the default config path should be the common case.
### 2025-12-15 12:10 - User feedback: my initial `init` doc rewrites were not empathetic/usable enough; user updated `docs/commands/init.md` directly to a better standard. Ask user to point out what specifically improved so I can apply the same tone/structure across other command docs without rework.
### 2025-12-15 12:11 - Empathy/tone takeaways from the improved `docs/commands/init.md`: lead with user outcome + default location; add a “when you use this” sentence; keep a single minimal example; include one actionable “if this fails, do this” recovery hint (offline latest-version); present flags in a table with clear allowed values + concrete examples; define a key term section (“Loaders…”) and list supported values.
### 2025-12-15 12:15 - User preference: avoid curly quotes and non-ASCII “smart” punctuation in user-facing docs (use plain ASCII quotes and hyphens; avoid non-breaking hyphens/en-dashes/em-dashes).
### 2025-12-15 12:21 - Docs structure updated: internal command specs moved to `docs/specs/` (e.g., `docs/specs/init.md` retains behaviour/edge-cases format). `docs/commands/` is now user-facing docs and must follow the conversational tone + empathy + plain ASCII guidelines from AGENTS.md.
### 2025-12-15 12:25 - README strategy: start removing embedded command docs from root `README.md` and link out to `docs/commands/*.md` instead (better for keeping README small and for future Docusaurus). Implemented for INIT and tracked follow-up as Beads `mmm-27`.
### 2025-12-15 12:27 - User preference for root README: do not keep redundant per-command blurbs once the TOC links to the user-facing docs; remove the `### INIT` section entirely (TOC link is enough).
### 2025-12-15 12:28 - Created Beads epic `mmm-28` to implement a Docusaurus docs site following the pattern used by https://github.com/meza/Stonecraft, using domain minecraftmodmanager.com, and sourcing user-facing docs from `docs/commands`.
### 2025-12-15 12:29 - Closed `mmm-3` per user request after init persistence + defaults/flags + quiet/overwrite behavior landed and verification targets were green.
### 2025-12-15 12:40 - mmm-26 alignment: keep init non-interactive for now and fail fast when the mods folder is missing or points to a file (quiet mode included); updated specs/user docs and added tests.
### 2025-12-15 13:05 - mmm-26 follow-up: user clarified specs under docs/specs are not living docs; avoid editing them. go mod tidy and make test with GOPROXY=direct GOSUMDB=off still fail because outbound HTTPS to module sources is blocked with CONNECT 403, so verification needs offline deps or a reachable proxy.

### 2025-12-15 13:18 - Internet access restored; go mod tidy now succeeds with default proxy, and verification gates pass (make test/coverage-enforce/build) for mmm-26 branch.

### 2025-12-15 13:28 - Installed bd v0.30.0 manually from the GitHub release tarball (npm postinstall download failed with ENETUNREACH) and placed the binary in /usr/local/bin for Beads CLI use.
### 2025-12-15 13:28 - Closed mmm-26 via bd --no-db close with reason "Implemented fail-fast mods folder handling; tests/docs updated"; no code changes needed beyond .beads sync.
### 2025-12-15 14:25 - New session; no tasks in progress. Ready list points to mmm-4 (list command) as next in epic order after finishing init work; mmm-20 remains a small bugfix option but priority stays on epic sequencing unless justified otherwise.
### 2025-12-15 14:28 - User wants init Bubble Tea flow (mmm-1.1) prioritized to make future commands TUI-aware; claimed mmm-1.1 in progress.
### 2025-12-15 15:03 - Implemented init Bubble Tea flow (mmm-1.1): TUI collects loader/game version/release types/mods folder with injected minecraft client and mods folder validation; quiet skips TUI; docs mention interactive path. Added tests for offline manifest entry, release type selection, state transitions, and TUI decision helper; make test/coverage-enforce/build all green.
### 2025-12-15 15:18 - Removed `--tui` flag per user direction; TUI now default on TTY unless `--quiet` or non-tty. Docs updated accordingly; tests/coverage/build rerun and green.
### 2025-12-15 15:34 - TUI copy aligns with Node prompts; defaults now seed latest game version; provided flags skip questions; interactive init type assertion fixed. All make targets remain green.
### 2025-12-15 16:22 - New session to inspect current repo state after previous agent attempts; working tree shows fresh init TUI changes and new release types/mods folder models; need to determine current failing task and summarize for user before proceeding.
### 2025-12-15 16:25 - Found uncommitted init TUI rework: new release types + mods folder models, terminal detection for auto-TUI, game version normalization, and injected minecraft client in TUI. Tests/coverage/build currently green. Note: TUI default release types now release+beta (CLI default is release); .beads has mmm-1.1 marked ready, mmm-22 still open, no tasks in_progress.
### 2025-12-15 16:27 - Set mmm-1.1 to in_progress per instructions; user requested “full snapshot tests for each possible TUI state” for init flow to verify screens accurately.
### 2025-12-15 16:40 - Added go-snaps snapshot tests for init TUI states (loader, game version, release types, mods folder, done) in cmd/mmm/init/tui_snapshot_test.go with generated snapshot file; make test/coverage-enforce/build all green post-change.
### 2025-12-15 16:49 - Snapshots updated to show full mocked latest Minecraft version (1.21.1) and complete mods folder input; used UPDATE_SNAPS to refresh snapshots. Verification targets still green.
### 2025-12-15 16:57 - Removed extra blank lines between TUI questions (single newline now) and refreshed snapshots; make test/coverage-enforce/build still green.
### 2025-12-15 17:08 - Game version prompt now hidden entirely when provided via CLI flag; added appendGameVersion helper and a test ensuring the question never appears in that flow. Snapshots unchanged for default flow; verification targets remain green.
### 2025-12-15 17:20 - Mods folder placeholder now uses resolved path (meta.ModsFolderPath) instead of a single letter; added test to lock placeholder value. Snapshots refreshed and all verification targets green.
### 2025-12-15 17:29 - Ensured mods folder placeholder fully visible by sizing text input to the placeholder length; added test for width. All make targets remain green.
### 2025-12-15 17:34 - Removed defensive placeholder guards; input width now always sized from placeholder length. Tests/coverage/build still green.
### 2025-12-15 17:45 - Placeholder acceptance now automatic: hitting enter with empty input uses the placeholder for game version and mods folder; mods placeholder is the relative `mods` while width is sized off resolved path. Added unit tests for both behaviors; snapshots refreshed; verification targets remain green.
### 2025-12-15 17:58 - All provided flags now hide their questions in the TUI (loader/game version/release types/mods folder); added view regression test. Enter-on-empty now uses placeholders for game version and mods folder. Verification targets still green.
### 2025-12-15 18:10 - Snapshot tests now use MMM_TEST for translation-key outputs; TUI view now hides questions only when supplied via CLI (tracked separately via initialProvided). Snapshots regenerated; verification targets remain green.
### 2025-12-15 18:18 - Default release types in TUI now align with docs (release only, not release+beta); snapshots regenerated under MMM_TEST. All make targets still green.
### 2025-12-15 18:28 - Added error-state snapshots (invalid version, empty release types, missing mods folder) under MMM_TEST to lock UX; helper supports custom options/FS setup. Verification still green.
### 2025-12-15 17:40 - New session. Ready list shows no in-progress issues; open items before mmm-4 include mmm-20 (locale detection bug), mmm-22 (init TUI offline client injection), mmm-25 (config defaults cleanup), mmm-27 (README init section removal), and mmm-28 (docs site epic). mmm-1.1 closed. Asked to confirm any stragglers before starting mmm-4.
### 2025-12-15 17:47 - Verified stragglers: mmm-22 already addressed by init TUI Doer injection + offline tests; mmm-25 obsolete since init collects loader/release types and resolves latest at runtime; mmm-27 done (README links to docs/commands/init.md, no init section). Closed all three via bd.
### 2025-12-15 17:55 - Fixed mmm-20: getUserLocales now reserves capacity instead of pre-filling to avoid leading empty locale entries; provider test tightened to assert exact locales and absence of empties. make test, make coverage-enforce (100%), make build all green; mmm-20 closed via bd.
### 2025-12-15 18:03 - Added new task mmm-29 to track migration to kaptinlin/go-i18n with ICU-style translations; description includes API/file-format/Crowdin workflow evaluation, prototype plan, and risks. mmm-20 closure re-confirmed in Beads.
### 2025-12-15 18:06 - Claimed mmm-29 (ICU i18n migration) and set status to in_progress; next step is to review current i18n implementation and kaptinlin/go-i18n requirements.
### 2025-12-15 18:17 - Converted language JSON files (runtime + fixtures) to ICU format: flattened keys to strings, switched placeholders to {var}, and consolidated plural forms into ICU plural blocks per kaptinlin/go-i18n expectations.
### 2025-12-15 18:21 - Added issue note for mmm-29: keep internal/i18n T signature and API unchanged during migration; existing tests should remain valid when wiring to new library.
### 2025-12-15 18:34 - Migrated internal/i18n to kaptinlin/go-i18n v0.1.2 (Go 1.24-compatible), preserved T signature/MMM_TEST behavior, and added coverage fixtures/tests for invalid locale files and default-locale insertion; verification via make test/coverage-enforce/build all green.
### 2025-12-15 18:54 - Added docs/i18n.md for engineers (ICU rules, key naming, usage of T/Tvars, locale files). Simplified locale setup (default first, single file per locale). Coverage/build still green after doc addition.
### 2025-12-15 19:10 - mmm-29 closed after ICU migration, module README co-located under internal/i18n, key rules verified (one file per locale, ICU placeholders, namespaces), and all make targets green.
### 2025-12-15 19:18 - New session: claimed mmm-4 (list command) per epic order; need to review docs/requirements-go-port.md, specs for list, Node reference under /tmp/mmm, and current init TUI patterns before planning.
### 2025-12-15 19:24 - mmm-4 clarifications: installed = lock entry match (id/type) with file present; hash verification can be future issue. Missing lock => no installed mods but no error/creation. List still outputs under quiet; debug only when enabled. Must add minimal Bubble Tea TUI for list (snapshot testable) for consistency. Add translation keys if missing per i18n guidelines.
### 2025-12-15 19:30 - Created follow-ups: mmm-30 (List hash verification), mmm-31 (List missing-lock UX), mmm-32 (Init telemetry capture) as discovered-from mmm-4.
### 2025-12-15 19:44 - Implemented mmm-4: added list command with aliases, shared CLI/TUI output, config+lock loading (missing lock => empty), installed detection via lock entry + file existence, telemetry emits mod count; added list TUI snapshot, translations, docs/commands/list.md, and verification (make test, coverage-enforce, build all green).
### 2025-12-15 19:50 - Restored colored output for list using internal/tui styling (green check, red cross, gray IDs) while keeping colors off in non-TTY; updated TUI snapshot accordingly; tests/coverage/build still green.
### 2025-12-15 20:12 - Refactored TUI helpers: added internal/tui terminal utilities (ShouldUseTUI/IsTerminalReader/Writer/ProgramOptions) and reused them in init/list; removed redundant terminal checks. Empty list now renders via TUI but also logs to stdout for persistence; coverage/build remain 100%.
### 2025-12-15 20:26 - Game version input now sets width to max(latest version, provided value, min 10) to avoid truncated placeholders (fix for Windows showing "1"); added test asserting placeholder contains resolved latest and width covers it; updated init TUI snapshots. Verification targets rerun (make test/coverage-enforce/build all green).
### 2025-12-15 20:44 - Claimed mmm-5 (add command). Reviewed requirements-go-port.md and specs/add.md; task is analysis/planning only for now. Need to mirror Node add behaviour (interactive retries, fallback logic) while designing a cleaner shared platform interface for Modrinth/CurseForge before implementation.
### 2025-12-15 21:37 - Implemented mmm-5: added Bubble Tea-driven add command with auto-init, prompts for unknown platform/mod-not-found/no-file, shared platform fetcher with fallback/pin, downloader wiring, user doc/i18n, and full test suite (platform adapters, CLI flows, TUI snapshots) with 100% coverage; make test/coverage-enforce/build all green.
### 2025-12-15 21:53 - New user feedback on mmm-5: runtime shows placeholder text (`Mod "{id}" for {platform}`) and modrinth fetch fails (`mod not found`) when adding fabric-api; expectation is Cobra-like error on missing args and same HTTP headers/.env loading as Node. Additional reminder to apply KISS/"You ain't gotta need it" and avoid over-defensive guards since modules aren't reused elsewhere.
### 2025-12-15 22:14 - Fixed Modrinth client to always send Authorization and normalize base URL (strip /v2); encoded version query params to stop 400s; added i18n var normalization so custom types (e.g., models.Platform) interpolate correctly; added debug logging around add fetch attempts. Tests/coverage/build remain 100%. Live repro now hits Modrinth OK but modmenu on gameVersion 1.21.11 is alpha-only, so default release-only configs still see NoCompatibleFile unless alpha/beta are allowed or fallback enabled.
### 2025-12-15 23:26 - Restarting mmm-5 after user dissatisfaction: current tree has defensive nil guards removed in add/list/init but add TUI snapshot/tests were rewritten to unit-test models (not command flows); user wants those reverted and snapshots driven by add command states like Node. They also demand mandatory dependencies (no optional logger/prompter guards) and adherence to Node headers/env behavior; need to plan fixes without coding yet and log notes in Beads.
### 2025-12-16 00:12 - Replaced add TUI snapshots with command-driven coverage under MMM_TEST: scenarios include missing args usage, unknown platform (retry/cancel/quiet), mod-not-found (retry/cancel/quiet), no-file (retry/cancel/quiet), already exists (debug), happy path, download error, and debug fetch logging; prompts recorded via prompter that renders Bubble Tea models with real i18n data. Removed low-level model-only snapshots and reverted accidental MMM_TEST hook in tui terminal options. make test/build green; manual coverage check via go tool cover shows 100% (make coverage-enforce reports 124 in harness but cover output confirms full coverage).
### 2025-12-16 00:35 - Cleaned snapshots to ASCII (replaced ellipsis), ensured make coverage-enforce passes with extended timeout, and regenerated add TUI snapshots; prompter stub still renders Bubble Tea models per command-driven flows (MMM_TEST on) for all add states including quiet/debug variants.
### 2025-12-16 01:15 - Reworked add TUI snapshots again: now drive Bubble Tea prompts with scripted key sequences and capture stdout/stderr per command state (unknown platform, mod-not-found, no-file, quiet, already-exists, happy path, download error, debug logs) under MMM_TEST. Removed ANSI/CR from snapshots for clarity; tests/coverage/build all green.
### 2025-12-16 10:00 - New direction for add TUI: refactor away from multiple prompt-specific Bubble Tea programs into a single add-command Bubble Tea app implemented as a finite state machine; add black-box e2e snapshot tests with github.com/charmbracelet/x/exp/teatest that cover every FSM state and run with MMM_TEST=true so i18n emits raw keys+data.
### 2025-12-16 10:06 - Clarified add TUI interaction rules: do not invent a downloading/progress state unless UX already has one; Esc must always go up one step (not abort), while Ctrl+C aborts the whole add flow. Plan recorded into beads issue mmm-5 notes.
### 2025-12-16 10:25 - Refactored add TUI to a single Bubble Tea FSM (cmd/mmm/add/tui_app.go) and removed the old multi-program prompt runner; added teatest-driven snapshots for all FSM states under MMM_TEST; updated add tests to cover interactive paths via a deterministic terminal-detection override (internal/tui.SetIsTerminalFuncForTesting). Verified with make test/coverage-enforce/build and refreshed snapshots.
### 2025-12-16 10:44 - Revised add TUI UX to match Node prompt flow: removed the invented “form” screen and hard-coded English footer, aligned messages with Node phrasing (including newline in unknown-platform), used list/textinput prompt layouts, and refreshed teatest snapshots to cover each FSM prompt state under MMM_TEST. make test/coverage-enforce/build all green.
### 2025-12-16 11:05 - Created beads task mmm-34 to add a build-time static analyzer enforcing i18n var “stringability” (TData values must be primitives or fmt.Stringer) to prevent silent placeholder failures in ICU formatting.
### 2025-12-16 11:09 - Removed internal/i18n var normalization and relied on fmt.Stringer: added models.Platform.String(), updated i18n tests to use a custom fmt.Stringer, and added internal/models/platform_test.go to keep 100% coverage. Verified via make test/coverage-enforce/build.
### 2025-12-16 11:16 - Began docs cleanup for add: migrated the detailed README add section into docs/commands/add.md and updated README links/TOC to point to the command doc instead of an in-README anchor.
### 2025-12-16 11:22 - Created beads task mmm-35 to move documentation assets from doc/images to docs/images and update markdown references; intended to block the future Docusaurus docs work (dependency may need adjustment once the Docusaurus issue ID is confirmed).
### 2025-12-16 11:23 - Updated mmm-35 dependency to block mmm-28 (Docs: add Docusaurus site) instead of mmm-13 after locating the correct Docusaurus epic in beads.
### 2025-12-16 11:29 - Docs task: update `docs/tui-guidelines.md` Developer Guide to document the purpose-built Bubble Tea FSM architecture (per-command app, no generalization), black-box teatest snapshots under `MMM_TEST=true`, and reuse of `internal/tui` keybinds/styles. Need to keep the markdown ASCII-only (current file contains non-ASCII glyphs) while editing.
### 2025-12-16 11:31 - Updated `docs/tui-guidelines.md` Developer Guide with the add-style Bubble Tea FSM architecture + snapshot testing guidance (teatest + MMM_TEST + go-snaps), and normalized the entire file to ASCII-only. make test still green.
### 2025-12-16 11:34 - Reverted all edits outside `## Developer Guide` in `docs/tui-guidelines.md` per request, restoring the original non-ASCII typography in the rest of the document. make test still green.
### 2025-12-16 11:41 - Docs request: create an internal engineer-focused `internal/platform/README.md` that documents the platform module with empathetic, clear writing modeled after the root README; avoid empty filler phrasing like "this section is for...". Need to inspect `internal/platform` implementation and describe responsibilities, entry points, typical flows, and extension points.
### 2025-12-16 11:41 - Read persona documentation guidelines (Engineer.md + DocumentationGuidelines.md): prioritize purpose/why, use headings as navigation, keep Markdown ASCII-only, avoid filler marketing phrases, include minimal runnable examples, and link instead of duplicating. Applied these to a new internal module README for `internal/platform`.
### 2025-12-16 11:47 - New docs sweep task (mmm-36): add similar engineer-focused README.md files for other `internal/*` packages that currently lack module-level documentation, keeping content DRY by linking to existing docs rather than duplicating.
### 2025-12-16 11:50 - Implemented mmm-36 docs sweep: added module-level READMEs for `internal/config`, `internal/constants`, `internal/curseforge`, `internal/environment`, `internal/fileutils`, `internal/globalErrors`, `internal/httpClient`, `internal/logger`, `internal/minecraft`, `internal/models`, `internal/perf`, `internal/tui`, plus placeholder READMEs for currently-empty `internal/cli` and `internal/output`. Verified with make test/coverage-enforce/build.
### 2025-12-16 11:55 - New pilot docs task (mmm-37): add a short maintainer README for `cmd/mmm/add` that links to the authoritative user docs and specs, and only adds code-adjacent maintenance notes (wiring, flow splits, tests/snapshots, error mapping). If the format works, replicate across other commands.
### 2025-12-16 11:57 - Added `cmd/mmm/add/README.md` as the pilot command maintainer doc: links to `docs/commands/add.md` and `docs/specs/add.md`, includes a small code map, runtime flow summary, TUI gating/state-machine notes, and how to update snapshots (`UPDATE_SNAPS=true make test`). All make targets still green.
### 2025-12-16 11:59 - New docs sweep task (mmm-38): replicate the `cmd/mmm/add/README.md` maintainer README pattern across all other implemented `cmd/mmm/*` command packages, linking to `docs/commands/*.md` and `docs/specs/*.md` where applicable.
### 2025-12-16 12:00 - Completed mmm-38: added maintainer READMEs for `cmd/mmm` (root wiring) and command packages `cmd/mmm/init`, `cmd/mmm/list`, and `cmd/mmm/version`, each linking to the relevant `docs/commands/*.md` and `docs/specs/*.md` files and documenting code map, flow, and snapshot update commands. Verified make test/coverage-enforce/build.
### 2025-12-16 12:03 - New docs polish task (mmm-39): review the internal module READMEs that predated the docs sweep (internal/i18n, internal/lifecycle, internal/modrinth, internal/telemetry) and bring them up to the newer README tone/structure without losing any information.
### 2025-12-16 12:06 - Updated pre-existing internal READMEs to match the newer module-doc style while preserving content: `internal/i18n/README.md` (added link to docs guide + standardized header), `internal/lifecycle/README.md` (ASCII-only + explicit guarantees/exit codes), `internal/modrinth/README.md` (expanded to a proper maintainer guide + links), `internal/telemetry/README.md` (ASCII-only + aligned with actual main.go usage). make test/coverage-enforce/build all green.
### 2025-12-16 12:09 - Created beads task mmm-40: instrument full process lifecycle with `internal/perf` (startup -> command execution -> shutdown, including signal shutdown) and ensure telemetry init/capture/shutdown is bracketed so perf data can be correlated with telemetry and measured end-to-end. Tests should assert the lifecycle marks/measurements.
### 2025-12-16 12:13 - mmm-40 open questions: confirm canonical perf region/mark names for app lifecycle (startup/execute/shutdown + signal vs graceful), what "startup" should include (env load + telemetry init + lifecycle wiring?), and whether command execution should treat "no args -> TUI" as one region or per-command subregions.
### 2025-12-16 12:23 - mmm-40 clarified: use namespaced lifecycle markers (implemented as `app.lifecycle.{startup,execute,shutdown}`), startup should cover time until we begin command execution, signal path can be tested via direct handler invocation (still assert we register the handler), and shutdown should be single-call safe (sync.Once).
### 2025-12-16 12:25 - mmm-40 follow-up expectation from user: lifecycle-only perf is insufficient; they want visibility into commands + key functions + HTTP calls so perf can answer (1) user behavior, (2) what gets used most, (3) what needs optimization. Next step: agree on a marker taxonomy and add per-command regions (and possibly standardize/namespace existing HTTP/perf markers).
### 2025-12-16 12:33 - mmm-40 execution: added per-command perf regions (`app.command.*`) and migrated existing perf markers to the taxonomy across HTTP (`net.http.*`), downloads (`io.download.*`), config/lock (`io.config.*`), and platform APIs (`api.{modrinth,curseforge,minecraft}.*`). Next: run full make gates and update any tests/docs that assume legacy names.
### 2025-12-16 12:38 - User feedback on mmm-40: command boundary regions are insufficient; they want instrumentation for each user intent/interaction within flows (especially add TUI retries: initial attempt success vs retry path, platform switch, re-enter ID, etc). Next: add attempt-level regions and TUI state/action marks for `cmd/mmm/add` (and then replicate for init/list TUI).
### 2025-12-16 12:58 - Added platform-layer perf: `platform.FetchMod` now emits `platform.fetch_mod` (with success + error_type + selection inputs). Added tests asserting the region exists and carries expected details. Updated perf taxonomy + internal/platform docs.
### 2025-12-16 13:04 - Added TUI thinking-time instrumentation: `tui.add.wait.<state>` and `tui.init.wait.<state>` regions start on state entry and end on user actions (select/confirm/submit/back/abort). Added tests asserting wait regions exist; make test/coverage-enforce/build all green.
### 2025-12-16 13:05 - Added perf "strategy/ethos" section in `internal/perf/README.md` describing layered instrumentation goals (diagnosis), zoom-ladder granularity, safe/low-cardinality details guidance, and test expectations.
### 2025-12-16 13:22 - Started mmm-41 (linked from mmm-40): added `--perf` + `--perf-out-dir` flags and best-effort export to `<outDir>/mmm-perf.json` on shutdown. Default out dir is the resolved `--config` directory; absolute path details are normalized relative to that directory. Added full tests to keep internal coverage at 100%.
### 2025-12-16 13:31 - Tweaked `mmm-perf.json` export schema: marks now emit `timestamp`; measurements emit `start_timestamp` + `duration_ns` (instead of `start_time` + `duration`). Updated tests and `internal/perf/README.md` accordingly; make gates green.
### 2025-12-16 13:36 - Created beads task mmm-42 for correlated perf spans (ids + parent/link DAG) to make parallel work attribution deterministic; open questions: tree+links vs full DAG semantics and whether to align our span model with OpenTelemetry while keeping runtime/trace.
### 2025-12-16 13:38 - Updated mmm-42 with agreed decisions: use primary tree + links[] (DAG overall), one trace_id per process with pyramid structure (process -> command -> TUI -> stages), and align exported correlation schema with OpenTelemetry semantics while keeping runtime/trace as a low-level implementation detail.
### 2025-12-16 13:40 - Doc check: updated root `README.md` common options section to document `--perf` and `--perf-out-dir` and added a short "Performance logs" user guide with copy/paste examples. Left docs/specs unchanged (protected) even though global flags are duplicated there.
### 2025-12-16 13:41 - Closed beads tasks: mmm-40 (lifecycle + deep perf instrumentation + docs/tests) and mmm-41 (perf export flags + mmm-perf.json export + schema + tests). Left mmm-42 open for future correlated-span/DAG work.

### 2025-12-17 09:38 - Checked `.beads/issues.jsonl` for active work: `mmm-42` is the only issue marked `in_progress` (correlated perf spans: IDs + DAG links).

### 2025-12-17 09:42 - Read OTEL Go contrib instrumentation overview. For our CLI (HTTP clients, no server), `go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/instrumentation/net/http/otelhttp` looks like the main reuse target (wrap `http.RoundTripper` for standardized HTTP client spans + semconv attrs; can still layer our own retry/attempt spans above it). `otelhttptrace` exists for deeper net/httptrace timing, but likely optional. runtime/host packages are metrics-focused and probably not needed for mmm-42 traces-first scope.
### 2025-12-16 13:45 - Fixed Windows path separator regression in perf export: exported path strings now use forward slashes via `filepath.ToSlash`, tests updated, coverage back to 100%. Closed mmm-43.
### 2025-12-16 13:47 - Fixed Windows drive-letter path expectation in `main_test.go` for perf export config parsing by computing expected base/out dirs with `filepath.Abs`. Created+closed mmm-44. make test/coverage-enforce green.
### 2025-12-17 10:49 - Confirmed via `bd --no-db list --json` that `mmm-42` remains the only `in_progress` issue; re-read the ticket’s requirements/notes (tree parent + links for DAG, one trace per run, best-effort export) and refreshed persona + process guidelines before resuming work.
### 2025-12-17 10:59 - Resumed mmm-42 and ran full verification locally: `go fmt ./...`, `make test`, `make coverage-enforce`, `make build`. Fixed the lingering coverage failure (internal/perf was <100%) by adding tests covering re-init behavior, nil ctx/options, SetAttributes persistence, export edge cases (outDir default, mkdir/write failures, NaN attribute -> JSON marshal error), and snapshot link filtering helpers. Coverage is back to 100%.
### 2025-12-17 11:26 - Code review found `internal/perf/README.md` Public API section was stale (legacy Mark/Measure/Region). Updated README to reflect OTEL-based perf API, export schema (spans/events/links), and testing guidance; reran `go fmt ./...`, `make test`, `make coverage-enforce`, `make build` (all pass).
### 2025-12-17 11:37 - Updated perf export to be hierarchical by default: `mmm-perf.json` now exports only root spans with nested `children[]` (still includes `trace_id/span_id/parent_span_id` and `links[]` for DAG edges). Updated export tests and README; re-verified `make coverage-enforce` is still 100%.
### 2025-12-17 11:51 - Clarified vision: perf data is intended to be uploaded via telemetry (matching Node’s `performance.getEntries()` behavior). Updated `internal/telemetry.CaptureCommand` to attach the current perf span tree under `performance`, enabled perf collection by default in `main.go`, added `perf.GetExportTree(...)`, updated telemetry/perf docs, and kept `make coverage-enforce` at 100%.
### 2025-12-17 12:05 - Fixed telemetry duration parity: `mmm list` was emitting `CaptureCommand` without a Duration (so PostHog lacked duration_ms). Added duration timing inside `cmd/mmm/list/runList` and asserted it’s set in list tests. make gates still pass with 100% coverage.
### 2025-12-17 12:23 - Improved telemetry duration handling: duration_ms can now be derived from perf span data in `internal/telemetry` (using latest-ended `app.command.<name>` span), so commands don’t need to manually compute and set Duration. Refactored `add` and `list` to emit telemetry after ending the command span so perf-derived duration is available; updated tests and kept `make coverage-enforce` at 100%.
### 2025-12-17 12:31 - Closed beads issue mmm-42 after user review. Follow-ups captured as mmm-48 (baseline metrics + SLOs) and mmm-49 (session-level telemetry with full perf tree at shutdown).
