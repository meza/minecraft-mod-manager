{"id":"mmm-42","title":"Correlated perf spans (IDs + DAG links) for parallel operations","description":"Problem: Our exported perf log is a flat list of marks/measures. With parallel operations (goroutines, concurrent file ops, overlapping HTTP/download work), correlation is ambiguous and becomes guesswork.\n\nGoal: Provide robust causality and correlation so we can answer \"what spawned this?\" and attribute time to the right user intent/subroutine even when work overlaps.\n\nStrategy: Add an explicit correlation layer on top of perf instrumentation.\n\nRequirements:\n- Add stable identities: span_id for each region, trace_id for the process run.\n- Add causality: a primary parent_span_id plus optional links[] so the model can represent a DAG (not just a tree).\n- Preserve the existing semantic naming taxonomy (app.lifecycle.*, app.command.*, platform.*, api.*, net.http.*, io.*, tui.*) as the human query layer.\n- Add a lightweight propagation mechanism so child spans can inherit context across call stacks and goroutines (likely context.Context based), and allow explicit linking when a span has multiple logical parents.\n- Export schema update: emit spans/events with ids and links so consumers can reconstruct a tree/DAG deterministically (no interval-guessing).\n- Define top-level structure: per-process root with child command spans; commands may contain multiple TUI sessions and nested work (pyramid).\n- Keep behavior best-effort and non-blocking: no CLI output changes, no exit code changes.\n- Testing: 100% coverage for new code. Add deterministic tests proving parent/child linkage and link edges under simulated parallel execution.\n- Docs: update internal/perf/README.md with guidance on when to use parent vs link, how to propagate context, and how this interacts with tui wait spans.\n\nNotes:\n- Tree vs DAG: Use a single primary parent for the \"main\" containment hierarchy, and links for cross-cutting correlation (e.g., an HTTP request that should be attributed to both a command stage and a module invocation).\n- Consider aligning the span model with OpenTelemetry semantics (trace_id/span_id/parent, links) while keeping runtime overhead low; keep runtime/trace as an implementation detail for Go execution tracing.","design":"## Implementation Plan: OpenTelemetry Integration (Clean Break)\n\n### Philosophy\n\nWe instrument for diagnosis, not vanity metrics. The goal is answering \"why is X slow?\" with confidence:\n- Which part of the user flow dominates wall time?\n- User thinking vs system work?\n- Which subsystem (platform, API, HTTP, filesystem)?\n- Which entrypoint or retry loop is responsible?\n\nThis requires proper correlation. OTEL provides it natively via context propagation.\n\n### Approach: Clean Replacement (No Legacy Layer)\n\nReplace internal/perf entirely with OTEL-backed implementation. Update ALL existing call sites to thread context properly. No compatibility shims.\n\n### 1. Dependencies\n\n```\ngo.opentelemetry.io/otel\ngo.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace\ngo.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/stdout/stdouttrace\ngo.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace\ngo.opentelemetry.io/otel/attribute\ngo.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/resource\ngo.opentelemetry.io/otel/semconv/v1.26.0\n```\n\n### 2. New API (replaces existing)\n\n```go\n// Initialize tracing (call once in main.go)\nfunc Init(cfg Config) error\nfunc Shutdown(ctx context.Context) error\n\n// Span creation - ALWAYS requires context\nfunc StartSpan(ctx context.Context, name string, opts ...SpanOption) (context.Context, *Span)\n\n// Span methods\nfunc (s *Span) End()\nfunc (s *Span) SetAttributes(attrs ...attribute.KeyValue)\nfunc (s *Span) AddEvent(name string, opts ...trace.EventOption)\nfunc (s *Span) Link() trace.Link  // for DAG relationships\n\n// Context helpers\nfunc SpanFromContext(ctx context.Context) *Span\nfunc LinkFromContext(ctx context.Context) trace.Link\n\n// Options\nfunc WithAttributes(attrs ...attribute.KeyValue) SpanOption\nfunc WithLinks(links ...trace.Link) SpanOption\n\n// Testing\nfunc Reset()  // clear global state between tests\n```\n\n### 3. Package Structure\n\n```\ninternal/perf/\n  config.go    # Config struct, Init/Shutdown\n  span.go      # Span wrapper, StartSpan, options\n  export.go    # File writer for --perf flag\n  perf_test.go # All tests\n  README.md    # Updated documentation\n```\n\nRemove: The current Mark/Measure/Region pattern. OTEL spans handle start/end/duration natively.\n\n### 4. Migration of Call Sites\n\nThread context.Context through all code paths:\n\n**main.go:**\n- Create root span, pass ctx to command execution\n- Shutdown flushes all spans\n\n**Commands (cmd/mmm/*):**\n- Accept ctx from Cobra via cmd.Context()\n- Create command span: `ctx, span := perf.StartSpan(ctx, \"app.command.add\")`\n- Pass ctx to all downstream calls\n\n**Platform layer (internal/platform):**\n- All public functions accept ctx as first param\n- Create spans like `platform.fetch_mod`\n\n**HTTP client (internal/httpClient):**\n- DoWithContext creates `net.http.request` span\n- Child spans for retries: `net.http.request.attempt`\n\n**API clients (internal/curseforge, internal/modrinth):**\n- All methods accept ctx\n- Create spans like `api.modrinth.project.get`\n\n**Config I/O (internal/config):**\n- Read/Write accept ctx\n- Spans like `io.config.read`, `io.config.lock.write`\n\n**TUI (cmd/mmm/*/tui.go):**\n- Store ctx in model\n- Spans for state transitions: `tui.add.state.fetching`\n- Events for user actions\n\n### 5. Preserve Semantic Naming\n\nKeep the existing taxonomy:\n- `app.lifecycle.*` - startup, execute, shutdown\n- `app.command.*` - user-initiated commands\n- `platform.*` - orchestration layer\n- `api.\u003cprovider\u003e.*` - API calls\n- `net.http.*` - HTTP transport\n- `io.*` - filesystem operations\n- `tui.*` - interactive UI\n\n### 6. Export (--perf flag)\n\nUse stdouttrace with file writer. Output is standard OTEL JSON:\n- TraceID, SpanID, ParentSpanID for correlation\n- Attributes for details (success, provider, status, attempt, etc.)\n- Links for DAG relationships\n- Timestamps and durations\n\nViewable in Jaeger, Chrome tracing, or any OTEL-compatible tool.\n\n### 7. Testing Strategy\n\n- Use in-memory exporter for tests\n- Assert span hierarchy (parent-child relationships)\n- Assert span attributes match expected details\n- Test parallel operations produce correct links\n- Each test calls perf.Reset() via t.Cleanup()\n- 100% coverage required\n\n### 8. Execution Order\n\n1. Add OTEL dependencies to go.mod\n2. Rewrite internal/perf with new API\n3. Update main.go with Init/Shutdown and root span\n4. Update internal/httpClient to accept and propagate ctx\n5. Update internal/config to accept ctx\n6. Update internal/curseforge and internal/modrinth to accept ctx\n7. Update internal/platform to accept ctx\n8. Update each command (init, add, list, version) to thread ctx\n9. Update TUI models to store and use ctx\n10. Update tests throughout\n11. Update internal/perf/README.md\n12. Verify make test \u0026\u0026 make coverage-enforce \u0026\u0026 make build\n\n### 9. Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. All spans within one CLI run share the same TraceID\n2. Nested operations show correct parent-child hierarchy\n3.

It is intentionally practical: each item includes what it catches and how it should be automated.\n\n### Baseline quality gates (should run on every PR)\n\n- Formatting:\n  - `gofmt` (canonical formatting; already effectively covered).\n  - Optional: `goimports` (import grouping and cleanup) if you want stronger standardization than gofmt alone.\n  - Automation pattern: a CI check that fails if formatting changes would be produced (do not auto-commit).\n- Static analysis:\n  - `go vet` (basic correctness checks; already run in this audit, not currently a CI gate).\n  - `staticcheck` (strong general-purpose lints; already run in this audit, not currently a CI gate).\n  - Alternative: `golangci-lint` as a wrapper to run multiple linters consistently; if used, pin the version and keep the enabled linters minimal and intentional to avoid noisy false positives.\n- Tests:\n  - `go test ./...` (already a CI gate).\n  - `go test -race ./...` (should be a CI gate once races are fixed; today it fails and is a blocker).\n  - Coverage enforcement: ensure the policy you claim is what you enforce (current `make coverage` covers `./internal/...` only).\n\n### Security automation (should run on every PR or at least daily)\n\n- Vulnerability scanning:\n  - `govulncheck` (official Go vuln tool). Given current symbol-scan instability in this repo, run `-scan=module` and `-scan=package` in CI until symbol scan is reliable again.\n  - Also gate on the Go toolchain patch level. Today the effective toolchain is `go1.25.0` and govulncheck reports fixed stdlib vulnerabilities; pin to a patched `go1.25.x` toolchain.\n- Dependency change review (GitHub, not Go-specific but directly relevant):\n  - `actions/dependency-review-action` to block PRs that introduce known-vulnerable dependencies (pairs well with Renovate automerge).\n- Optional static security analysis:\n  - `gosec` can be useful for obvious mistakes, but expect false positives and treat it as advisory unless you tune it.\n\n### Reliability and robustness (targets specific risks in this repo)\n\n- Fuzzing:\n  - Use Go's built-in fuzzing (`go test -fuzz=...`) for parsers and boundary logic (modlist/lock parsing, URL parsing/normalization, filename validation, and any JSON decoding of upstream API responses).\n  - Automate as a time-bounded CI job (nightly) to avoid slowing PRs.\n- HTTP correctness and timeouts:\n  - Prefer tests that assert all outbound HTTP uses timeouts (unit tests can validate constructed `http.Client` timeouts and request context deadlines).\n  - Add a regression test suite that intentionally sends malformed JSON and non-200 statuses to ensure decode/status errors are propagated (this targets the \"ignored decode error\" findings).\n\n### Release artifact integrity (Go ecosystem tooling that fits this repo)\n\n- Packaging, checksums, and provenance:\n  - Consider `goreleaser` to consistently build cross-platform artifacts, generate checksums, and attach release assets in a predictable way (even if you keep semantic-release for versioning).\n  - Consider signing and provenance (for example, cosign/SLSA-style attestations). This is not strictly \"Go tooling\", but it is commonly integrated into Go release pipelines and addresses the current \"zip only, no integrity metadata\" gap.\n\n### Licensing and SBOM (automate compliance and transparency)\n\n- License inventory:\n  - `go-licenses` for a repeatable dependency license report (already executed during this audit).\n  - Automate generation of a `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt` (or similar) for each release and attach it to the release (or bundle it in `dist/*.zip`).\n- SBOM generation (Go-centric options):\n  - `cyclonedx-gomod` to generate a CycloneDX SBOM directly from `go.mod`/`go.sum`.\n  - Alternative: `syft` can generate SPDX/CycloneDX SBOMs, but it is not Go-specific.\n\n### Tool version pinning (avoid \"works on my machine\" tooling drift)\n\n- Pin tool versions the same way you pin dependencies:\n  - Add a `tools.go` (build-tagged) to track tool dependencies.\n  - Install tools in CI using `go install \u003cmodule\u003e@\u003cversion\u003e` so the toolchain is deterministic.\n- Avoid using floating versions in CI (Go toolchain and Actions). Prefer pinned patch versions and pinned action SHAs.\n\n## Recommended Remediation Plan (order)\n\n1. Remove env-driven API base URL overrides and replace with test/build injection; reconsider runtime `.env` autoload scope (see Critical exfiltration finding).\n2. Fix path traversal risks by validating all filenames from remote/lock/config before any filesystem operation.\n3. Make the suite race-clean and add `go test -race ./...` to CI.\n4. Fix release automation consistency: either enable and align semantic-release for Go, or remove the Node-era config.\n5. Make docs truthful to the current Go binary and remove references to unimplemented commands from user docs.\n6. Add bounded timeouts and robust retry behavior across all HTTP operations.\n7. Harden downloads: validate HTTP status, verify file hashes, prevent symlink overwrites, and make update swaps atomic.\n8. Add CI gates for staticcheck (or golangci-lint) and govulncheck (at least module/package scan until symbol scan is stable).\n9. Add release/CI artifacts for license attribution (THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES) and consider an SBOM for each release.\n10. Update telemetry documentation and minimize sensitive payload fields while keeping opt-out.\n\n## Remediation checklist (acceptance criteria and evidence)\n\nThis section turns the highest-impact findings into a maintainer-executable checklist. Each item includes:\n\n- the required change outcome (what must be true)\n- acceptance criteria (what to run / what must pass)\n- artifacts to attach to prove closure (what evidence is required)\n\nWhere practical, prefer adding `make` targets for these checks and using those targets in CI, so local and CI behavior cannot drift.\n\n### Definition of done: \"release-ready\"\n\nThis project can be considered \"release-ready\" only when all items below are true and backed by verifiable evidence (CI logs, test outputs, and release asset listings). This is intentionally strict because the current findings include security-impacting footguns and release automation inconsistencies.\n\n- [ ] No blockers remain in `## Findings (prioritized)` (race-clean, release pipeline consistent, API base URL exfiltration control, and path safety addressed).\n- [ ] Every item in `## Remediation checklist (acceptance criteria and evidence)` is closed with the required evidence attached (or the maintainers explicitly document a risk acceptance decision and why).\n- [ ] CI on `main` enforces (and is required by branch protection):\n  - `make test`\n  - `make coverage` (or an updated coverage gate that matches the stated policy)\n  - `make test-race` (or equivalent race gate)\n  - lint gate (`staticcheck` or curated `golangci-lint`)\n  - vulnerability scan gate (`govulncheck` at least module/package)\n- [ ] Release automation is reproducible:\n  - a dry-run release job (no publish) succeeds end-to-end and produces exactly the expected assets\n  - release artifacts include integrity/metadata deliverables (checksums/signatures/provenance as chosen, plus `LICENSE` and third-party notices)\n- [ ] Telemetry invariants are enforced by tests (URLs allowed, secret headers forbidden) and shutdown is time-bounded in the real code path.\n\n### 1) Remove runtime API base URL overrides (credential exfiltration control)\n\n- [ ] Outcome: production code has no runtime configuration for API base URLs (CurseForge/Modrinth base URLs are fixed, not env-driven).\n- [ ] Acceptance criteria:\n  - `rg -n \"MODRINTH_API_URL|CURSEFORGE_API_URL\" .` returns no hits outside tests/tools (define and enforce what \"test-only\" means).\n  - All tests that previously depended on env URL overrides are migrated to an explicit injection seam (constructor param or test-only setter).\n  - `make test` passes.\n- [ ] Evidence to attach:\n  - A short log showing the `rg` search output (no runtime hits).\n  - A note describing the chosen test seam (API base URL injection mechanism) and where it is defined.\n\n### 2) Fix filesystem path safety (path traversal, symlink/reparse-point safety, predictable temp names)\n\n- [ ] Outcome: no untrusted remote metadata (filenames, URLs, IDs) can cause writes/deletes outside the intended mods folder or config directory.\n- [ ] Acceptance criteria:\n  - Add unit tests that prove the sanitizer rejects:\n    - relative traversal (`../x.jar`, `..\\\\x.jar`)\n    - absolute paths (`/etc/passwd`, `C:\\\\Windows\\\\system32\\\\x`)\n    - UNC paths (`\\\\\\\\server\\\\share\\\\x`)\n    - path separators in \"filenames\" from remote sources\n  - Add unit tests that prove write paths are symlink-safe (do not follow a symlink that points outside the directory) on supported platforms, or explicitly document platform limitations and add tests for those constraints.\n  - `make test` passes.\n  - If Windows is a supported target: add tests for Windows rename/replace semantics and reparse-point behavior (at minimum: do not overwrite through symlink-like constructs).\n- [ ] Evidence to attach:\n  - New/updated test names proving traversal rejection and symlink safety.\n  - A short explanation of the chosen safe-write strategy (how you prevent TOCTOU and symlink exploitation).\n\n### 3) Make the suite race-clean and gate it\n\n- [ ] Outcome: `go test -race` is clean and remains clean.\n- [ ] Acceptance criteria:\n  - Add a `make test-race` target that runs `go test -race ./...`.\n  - `make test-race` passes locally.\n  - CI runs `make test-race` and it passes on main.\n- [ ] Evidence to attach:\n  - CI job link or log excerpt showing the race job passed.\n  - A note listing the fixed race sites (by package/file) and what synchronization change was applied.\n\n### 4) Fix release automation consistency and artifact integrity\n\n- [ ] Outcome: release pipeline is deterministic, consistent with the Go repo layout, and does not silently produce wrong artifacts.\n- [ ] Acceptance criteria:\n  - Decide and document the release authority:\n    - either semantic-release is authoritative and configured for the Go repo, or it is removed/disabled for this repo.\n  - If semantic-release remains:\n    - `scripts/prepare.sh` must be robust (strict mode, validated inputs, portable or constrained to a documented runner OS).\n    - Asset selection globs in `.releaserc.json` must not pick up stale/unrelated zips (clean `dist/` before packaging or narrow globs).\n  - Add a CI \"release dry run\" on main (no publishing) that verifies the pipeline can run end-to-end and produce expected artifacts.\n- [ ] Evidence to attach:\n  - The command(s) used for the dry run and their output.\n  - A list of the expected release assets (filenames) and a proof they are the only assets produced.\n\n### 5) Bound all HTTP operations (timeouts and safe retries)\n\n- [ ] Outcome: no HTTP call can hang indefinitely; retries are safe even when upstream uses POST.\n- [ ] Acceptance criteria:\n  - Add explicit timeouts (client and/or per-request context) and prove via tests that a stuck server fails within a bounded window.\n  - Ensure retries:\n    - retry network errors as well as selected status codes (as intended)\n    - do not reuse a consumed request body (use a replayable body strategy)\n  - `make test` passes.\n- [ ] Evidence to attach:\n  - A test that simulates a non-responding handler and asserts bounded failure time.\n  - A test that retries a request with a body without data corruption.\n\n### 6) Stop ignoring decode/status/request-build errors (correctness and observability)\n\n- [ ] Outcome: invalid responses and malformed URLs fail fast with typed, user-relevant errors (no silent empty structs).\n- [ ] Acceptance criteria:\n  - For each API client:\n    - `http.NewRequestWithContext` errors are handled (no discarded error values).\n    - Non-2xx statuses are treated as errors before decode.\n    - JSON decode errors are returned (not ignored).\n  - Add tests for each of the above in Modrinth and CurseForge clients.\n  - `make test` passes.\n- [ ] Evidence to attach:\n  - Links to the specific tests covering \"bad URL\", \"non-200\", and \"bad JSON\" per client.\n\n### 7) Telemetry safety gates (URLs allowed, secret headers forbidden)\n\n- [ ] Outcome: telemetry and perf export can never include API keys or other secret header values, even under error conditions.\n- [ ] Acceptance criteria:\n  - Add a test that sets a known secret value (for example `MODRINTH_API_KEY=test-secret`) and asserts:\n    - recorded telemetry payloads contain request URL fields only as allowed\n    - no payload contains `test-secret` anywhere (string search over JSON payload)\n  - Ensure shutdown is time-bounded even when passed a non-nil context without deadline (fix the current \"timeout only when ctx==nil\" behavior).\n  - `make test` passes.\n- [ ] Evidence to attach:\n  - The redaction/leak-prevention tests and a short description of the redaction strategy.\n\n### 8) Toolchain and CI hardening (make it impossible to regress)\n\n- [ ] Outcome: CI prevents the regressions identified by this audit.\n- [ ] Acceptance criteria:\n  - Add CI jobs (prefer via `make` targets):\n    - formatting check (gofmt/goimports policy)\n    - lint (`staticcheck` or `golangci-lint`)\n    - vulnerability scan (`govulncheck` at least module/package)\n    - dependency review (GitHub) if you allow Renovate automerge\n  - Pin:\n    - GitHub Actions by SHA\n    - Go toolchain to a patched `go1.25.x` (and ensure the version used in CI matches the pinned version)\n  - CI permissions are least-privilege for PRs (avoid broad write permissions on PR runs).\n- [ ] Evidence to attach:\n  - Workflow diffs and a CI run showing all new gates passing.\n  - A note documenting the chosen Go patch version and the rationale (must address the govulncheck-reported stdlib fixes).\n\n### 9) Licensing and SBOM artifacts for releases\n\n- [ ] Outcome: distributed artifacts have transparent licensing and (optionally) SBOM metadata.\n- [ ] Acceptance criteria:\n  - Add a reproducible artifact generation step:\n    - `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt` (from `go-licenses report`, plus any manual notices required)\n    - optional: SBOM (CycloneDX or SPDX) for each release\n  - Ensure release artifacts include `LICENSE` and third-party notices (either bundled in zips or attached as separate assets with clear naming).\n- [ ] Evidence to attach:\n  - A sample release asset listing showing notices/SBOM present.\n  - The exact command(s) used to generate the notices/SBOM and how they are versioned.\n\n## Appendix - Package-by-package judgement (spotlight)\n\nThis is not a complete re-listing of all findings above; it is a quick \"where the bodies are buried\" index so reviewers can jump straight to the highest-risk packages.\n\n- `main.go`: runtime `.env` autoload (`main.go:12`), perf always enabled (`main.go:115`), telemetry shutdown not time-bounded (`main.go:155` plus `internal/telemetry/telemetry.go:381-400`).\n- `cmd/mmm/root.go`: help/version surface has drift and confusing overlaps (cobra default `completion`, global `-v/--version` plus `version` command), `--quiet` help text overpromises (\"Suppress all output\") vs actual behavior.\n- `cmd/mmm/add/*`: large command surface with duplicated helpers and at least one staticcheck smell (`cmd/mmm/add/add.go:328` assignments unused).\n- `cmd/mmm/init/*`: uses `http.DefaultClient` (`cmd/mmm/init/init.go:66-69`) and has user-visible help text issues (see existing init findings).\n- `cmd/mmm/install/*`: downloads jars to paths derived from untrusted metadata (remote filenames) and emits non-ASCII output even when not a TTY (see existing download/path traversal and output-contract findings).\n- `cmd/mmm/list/*`: violates \"purely informational/no prompts\" spec by running TUI flows (`cmd/mmm/list/list.go:112-133`) and uses non-ASCII glyphs in non-TTY output (`cmd/mmm/list/list.go:224-233`).\n- `cmd/mmm/remove/*`: can remove paths derived from lock metadata (`cmd/mmm/remove/remove.go:151-171`) and prints emoji in standard output (`cmd/mmm/remove/remove.go:171`).\n- `cmd/mmm/scan/*`: prints emoji via `tui.SuccessIcon`/`tui.ErrorIcon` even when `colorize=false` (`cmd/mmm/scan/scan.go:764-804`, `internal/tui/icons.go:3-17`).\n- `cmd/mmm/test/*`: concurrency-heavy; the test suite is not race-clean (`go test -race` fails in this package), and production goroutines call `i18n.T(...)` (see earlier concurrency finding).\n- `cmd/mmm/update/*`: update swap is not atomic and uses predictable temp/backup names (`cmd/mmm/update/update.go:389-456`), compounding the download integrity and symlink/TOCTOU issues.\n\n- `internal/config/*`: atomic write uses predictable sibling names (`internal/config/atomic_write.go:11-57`) and `afero.Exists` errors are ignored (`internal/config/config.go:20-23`, `internal/config/lock.go:18-26`).\n- `internal/httpClient/*`: no timeouts (`internal/httpClient/httpClient.go:124-131`), partial retry semantics and blocking sleep (`internal/httpClient/httpClient.go:51-105`), downloader writes without status checks and is not symlink-safe (`internal/httpClient/downloader.go:50-83`).\n- `internal/modrinth/*`: base URL override via env (must be removed from production) and JSON decode errors ignored (`internal/modrinth/project.go:81-83`, `internal/modrinth/version.go:128-130`, `internal/modrinth/version.go:156-158`).\n- `internal/curseforge/*`: base URL override via env (must be removed from production) and request build errors ignored (`internal/curseforge/project.go:26-31`, `internal/curseforge/files.go:57-63`, `internal/curseforge/files.go:112-119`).\n- `internal/platform/*`: default clients disable rate limiting (`internal/platform/platform.go:35-44`) and inherit the API client weaknesses above.\n- `internal/i18n/*`: global lazy init without synchronization (race risk), panics on setup and arg count, and common `LANG` formats are ignored (`internal/i18n/i18n.go:111-116`, `internal/i18n/i18n.go:156-159`).\n- `internal/telemetry/*`: opt-out telemetry includes full performance span trees and error strings; shutdown timeout is effectively dead in production (`internal/telemetry/telemetry.go:341-404`).\n- `internal/tui/*`: emoji icons are unconditional (`internal/tui/icons.go:3-17`); terminal detection seams exist but are not used to gate ASCII output in commands.\n- `internal/minecraft/*`: caches global manifest pointer, collapses distinct failure modes into sentinel errors, ignores request build errors (`internal/minecraft/minecraft.go:45-49`).\n\n## Appendix - Environment variables inventory (code-derived)\n\nDirect lookups observed in code:\n\n- `MODRINTH_API_KEY` (auth; runtime override for embedded key): `internal/environment/environment.go:13-20`\n- `CURSEFORGE_API_KEY` (auth; runtime override for embedded key): `internal/environment/environment.go:22-29`\n- `POSTHOG_API_KEY` (telemetry; runtime override for embedded key): `internal/environment/environment.go:31-38`\n- `MMM_DISABLE_TELEMETRY` (opt-out): `internal/telemetry/telemetry.go:588`\n- `MACHINE_ID` (distinct id override): `internal/telemetry/telemetry.go:574`\n- `LANG` (locale selection): `internal/i18n/i18n.go:112-116`\n- `MMM_TEST` (test-mode i18n behavior; risky if set at runtime): `internal/i18n/i18n.go:81-85`\n- `MODRINTH_API_URL` (base URL override; must be removed from production): `internal/modrinth/modrinthClient.go:40`\n- `CURSEFORGE_API_URL` (base URL override; must be removed from production): `internal/curseforge/curseforgeClient.go:38`\n\nJudgment:\n\n- Key-related vars (`*_API_KEY`) and telemetry vars are expected and align with your desired runtime `.env` behavior.\n- Base URL vars (`*_API_URL`) are a security footgun (credential exfiltration), and per maintainer decision must be deleted or made test-only via explicit injection.\n\n## Resolved maintainer decisions (applied)\n\n1. Runtime `.env` loading scope: load `.env` from CWD (global config will be added later).\n2. \"No args starts TUI\" contract: current version should print help; no-args TUI is a known gap while pushing for Node parity and will be added after parity is complete.\n3. Retry semantics: retries must remain enabled even for APIs using POST; implement safe request-body replay semantics.\n4. Telemetry may include request URLs, but must not include API keys from headers (or other secret header values).\n5. Perf artifacts (`mmm-perf.json`) are not considered sensitive.\n\n## Audit coverage closure (deep audits completed here)\n\nThis audit performed deep review of all in-repo repository setup surfaces (not only Go code):\n\n- GitHub automation and community health files (in-repo): `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `.github/renovate.json`, `.github/stale.yml`, `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/*`, `.github/instructions/*`, `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `FUNDING.yml`, `LICENSE`, `README.md`.\n- Dependency supply chain:\n  - Vulnerability posture via govulncheck (see Security findings).\n  - License inventory via `go-licenses report ./...` (see Licensing finding above).\n  - Renovate preset behavior validated by inspecting the referenced external preset (see CI/supply chain findings).\n- Beads process health: validated via `bd` CLI only (per project policy), not by reading `.beads/` directly.\n- Release automation and artifact integrity (in-repo): `.releaserc.json`, `scripts/*`, `Makefile`, and `dist/` artifact naming/globs.\n\n## Evidence not present in-repo (requires maintainer confirmation)\n\nItems that materially affect real-world security/release readiness but cannot be audited from this checkout because they live in GitHub/org settings or external services:\n\n- Branch protection rules and required checks (required reviews, required status checks, signed commits, force-push rules).\n- Which GitHub Apps are installed/configured (Renovate app settings, stale bot/probot, CodeQL, secret scanning/push protection, dependency review, etc.).\n- Secret governance (where tokens live, rotation policy, who can access them, whether PRs from branches can access secrets).\n- Release provenance/signing (checksums, signatures, attestations, and whether they are verified by consumers).\n- Telemetry/compliance posture from a legal standpoint (GDPR/PII policies, retention, DPA, user-facing consent text).\n\n## Audit limitations (honesty)\n\n- This report is evidence-backed but cannot literally guarantee every single issue in the entire codebase has been enumerated; it reflects best-effort repo-wide review using local execution, static analysis, and targeted manual inspection of high-risk boundaries (networking, filesystem, config, i18n, CI/release).\n\n## Auditor self-check (persona requirement)\n\nThis section is a consistency and reasoning check for the top findings. It does not introduce new requirements; it exists to ensure the report is internally coherent and evidence-backed.\n\n### Top 3 findings: chain of reasoning\n\n1) Runtime API base URL overrides (credential exfiltration footgun)\n\n- Evidence: base URLs can be overridden via env vars: `internal/modrinth/modrinthClient.go:40` and `internal/curseforge/curseforgeClient.go:38`.\n- Risk chain:\n  - runtime `.env` loading from CWD is enabled (maintainer decision)\n  - base URL env override is therefore easy to influence (malicious `.env`, accidental config)\n  - auth headers are attached to requests\n  - result: API keys can be sent to attacker-controlled endpoints\n- Why it is prioritized: it is a direct secret exfiltration path that does not depend on upstream compromise.\n- Confidence: High (direct code evidence, clear attack path).\n\n2) Filesystem path safety (path traversal and write/delete boundaries)\n\n- Evidence: commands derive filesystem paths from untrusted/remote metadata and lock contents (see the file safety findings in `## Findings (prioritized)` and the package spotlight references for install/update/remove).\n- Risk chain:\n  - remote metadata and lock files are treated as authoritative inputs\n  - filenames/paths can contain traversal or absolute path forms\n  - writes/deletes can occur outside the intended directory if not normalized/validated\n  - result: data loss or unintended overwrite is possible\n- Why it is prioritized: it affects integrity of user systems and is easy to exploit if any untrusted metadata is accepted.\n- Confidence: Medium-High (exact exploitability depends on current filename/URL handling per command, but the boundary is clearly not consistently defended).\n\n3) Release automation consistency (risk of shipping wrong artifacts)\n\n- Evidence: semantic-release and scripts appear misaligned with the Go repo layout and rely on brittle scripts:\n  - `.releaserc.json:42` references `./src/version.ts` which does not exist here\n  - `scripts/prepare.sh:6-13` rewrites tracked files, uses `sed -i` portability-sensitive behavior, and uses `$HELP_URL` without validation\n  - `scripts/binaries.sh:5-7` zips binaries without notices/integrity metadata\n- Risk chain:\n  - inconsistent or non-functional release pipeline means releases can be non-reproducible\n  - brittle scripts can silently generate wrong output (placeholders, missing URLs, wrong assets)\n  - broad artifact globs can upload stale or unintended zips\n  - result: end users may receive incorrect binaries and maintainers cannot reliably reproduce them\n- Why it is prioritized: it undermines trust in releases and makes security fixes harder to ship reliably.\n- Confidence: High (direct configuration/script evidence).\n\n### Internal consistency validation\n\n- Maintainer clarifications were applied:\n  - embedded API keys are intended (still requires preventing URL override exfiltration)\n  - runtime `.env` from CWD is intended (increases importance of hardening env parsing and removing URL overrides)\n  - telemetry is opt-out and may include URLs but must not include secret headers (report recommends tests to enforce this invariant)\n  - no-args behavior is help today; no-args TUI is a known future goal (docs must reflect current behavior)\n  - retries must remain enabled even for POST (report recommends safe body replay for retries)\n- Renovate preset ownership was updated: team-owned upstream changes are treated as governance/auditability considerations, not an external supply chain risk.\n\n### Major conclusions and confidence\n\n- \"Not release-ready\" verdict: High confidence (multiple independent blockers with direct evidence).\n- Highest-risk security boundary issues (URL override + path safety + unbounded HTTP/telemetry shutdown): Medium-High confidence (direct code evidence; some real-world exploitability depends on runtime environment and usage patterns, but the footguns are present).\n","acceptance_criteria":"All audit findings are ticketed; audit.md annotated with IDs","notes":"Replaced retired make coverage-enforce with make coverage.","status":"open","priority":0,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-19T21:23:15.347419978Z","updated_at":"2025-12-22T21:28:15.2233473Z","labels":["audit","blocker"]}

Maintainer confirms help is correct for the current version and the no-args TUI is a known gap while pushing for Node parity.\n- Command set mismatch: `mmm --help` does not list `change` or `prune`, but README/specs imply them. (Go port not complete per maintainer; therefore docs must reflect current state.)\n- Maintainer/package docs are also stale and conflict with code and build tooling:\n  - `internal/config/README.md` documents `ReadConfig(fs, meta)` and `EnsureLock(fs, meta)`, but the actual public API is context-aware: `internal/config/config.go:16` and `internal/config/lock.go:14`.\n  - `internal/httpClient/README.md` documents `DownloadFile(url, filepath, ...)`, but the actual API includes context: `internal/httpClient/downloader.go:40`.\n  - `internal/environment/README.md` claims release/CI injection uses `-ldflags -X` and \"not rewriting source files\": `internal/environment/README.md:28`, but `scripts/prepare.sh` rewrites `internal/environment/environment.go` in-place via `sed`: `scripts/prepare.sh:10-12` (and `.releaserc.json` still references `./src/version.ts`: `.releaserc.json:42`).\n\nImpact:\n\n- Users and contributors cannot rely on docs to understand current behavior.\n- Specs cannot be used as acceptance criteria if they describe unimplemented commands as current.\n\nRemediation:\n\n- Bring user-facing docs (especially `README.md` and `docs/commands/*`) into alignment with the Go binary that currently ships.\n- If some commands are not implemented yet, remove them from user docs or clearly mark them as unavailable in the current Go build without framing as \"future plans\" (per your documentation principles).\n- `docs/tui-design-doc.md` must stop claiming current behavior that is not implemented; treat it as an aspirational design doc and ensure user docs match today's behavior (help by default).\n\nAdditional evidence - command-by-command docs/specs vs current CLI (help + code):\n\n- Global flags and command set:\n  - Specs list only `--config`, `--quiet`, `--debug` and claim they must appear before the command name: `docs/specs/README.md:16-24`.\n  - The Go CLI also exposes `--perf` and `--perf-out-dir` global flags: `cmd/mmm/root.go:30-34`.\n  - Cobra also exposes a global `-v, --version` flag because `Version` is set: `cmd/mmm/root.go:24-28` (this directly conflicts with docs that claim `add` uses `-v` for its own `--version` flag).\n  - Verification: persistent flags are accepted after the command name (contradicting `docs/specs/README.md:24`), for example `mmm install --config ./modlist.json --help` works (exit code 0) and prints help.\n  - `mmm --help` includes a `completion` command (cobra default). This is not mentioned in `docs/specs/README.md:5-14` nor in `docs/commands/*`.\n\n- `add`:\n  - User docs claim short flags that do not exist:\n    - `docs/commands/add.md:23-24` claims `-f, --allow-version-fallback` and `-v, --version`.\n    - Actual flags are long-only (no shorthands): `cmd/mmm/add/add.go:148-149`.\n    - Additionally, `-v` is already taken by the global `--version` flag (see above), so the docs are not just stale; they are internally inconsistent with the current CLI surface.\n  - User docs say Modrinth requires a project slug, but the examples use what looks like a Modrinth project ID (base62-ish), not a slug:\n    - `docs/commands/add.md:8-9` uses `AANobbMI`\n    - `docs/commands/add.md:68-74` claims \"project slug (last part of the URL)\" for Modrinth\n    - The CLI likely accepts both slug and ID (Modrinth API does), so the docs should state \"slug or project ID\" to match reality.\n\n- `init`:\n  - User docs promise an interactive TUI when running in a terminal and a flag-driven flow in scripts: `docs/commands/init.md:11-13`. This broadly matches the code structure (TUI selection is terminal-dependent), but multiple help strings are incorrect and leak host-specific paths (see the dedicated finding on `init --mods-folder` help text).\n  - User docs include a process-oriented \"open an issue on GitHub\" note, which conflicts with the \"no future plans / no internal process\" constraint for user-facing docs: `docs/commands/init.md:30`.\n\n- `install`:\n  - User docs omit a major behavioral constraint: install can fail due to unmanaged/unresolved files and can suggest running `scan` first.\n    - Spec includes this preflight and failure mode: `docs/specs/install.md:6-16`.\n    - User docs (`docs/commands/install.md:1-37`) do not mention unmanaged file detection or the \"unresolved\" failure mode at all.\n  - User docs provide no flags/options table (even if the only options are global flags), which makes the page inconsistent with the other command docs and harder to use as a reference: `docs/commands/install.md:1`.\n\n- `list`:\n  - Specs claim the command is purely informational and has no prompts: `docs/specs/list.md:13-14`.\n  - Implementation can run in a TUI mode (interactive) depending on TTY and `--quiet`: `cmd/mmm/list/list.go:112-133`.\n  - Implementation prints non-ASCII check/cross glyphs in list output even when not using the TUI (this is a CLI output contract decision that should be documented): `cmd/mmm/list/list.go:224-233`.\n  - User docs are missing core usage/flags documentation and do not mention the TUI mode:\n    - `docs/commands/list.md:1-13` has no flags table and no mention of the interactive list UI.\n\n- `remove`:\n  - User docs claim `--dry-run` does not create a missing lock file: `docs/commands/remove.md:24-25`. This is true for dry-run specifically.\n  - However, non-dry-run will create `modlist-lock.json` if it is missing (via `EnsureLock`) even if there are no matching lock entries to remove: `cmd/mmm/remove/remove.go:178-191`.\n  - Implementation prints a hard-coded emoji check mark and bypasses i18n: `cmd/mmm/remove/remove.go:135-172`.\n\n- `scan`:\n  - Specs and user docs both claim persistence is skipped when any file is \"unsure\": `docs/commands/scan.md:20-21` and `docs/specs/scan.md:14-18`. This matches implementation: `cmd/mmm/scan/scan.go:264-276`.\n  - The docs still inherit the global `--quiet` description mismatch (\"no normal output\" vs \"suppress all output\") because the root flag help text is inaccurate: `cmd/mmm/root.go:31`.\n\n- `test`:\n  - User docs describe exit codes for automation: `docs/commands/test.md:26-35`. This aligns with the implementation intent (exit code 2 for same-version): `cmd/mmm/test/test.go:67-71`.\n  - CLI help output does not mention the exit code contract anywhere; this is a UX/doc mismatch for an \"automation-first\" command.\n  - Internal spec claims interactive prompting when the latest version lookup fails: `docs/specs/test.md:14`. Current implementation is non-interactive and instead requires an explicit version (see the maintainer clarification and `cmd/mmm/test/test.go:198-207`).\n\n- `update`:\n  - User docs and specs both describe \"runs install first\" behavior: `docs/commands/update.md:13-17` and `docs/specs/update.md:6-16`. This matches implementation: `cmd/mmm/update/update.go:157-165`.\n\nConfidence: High.\n\n\n# Acceptance criteria\n\n- Implement all remediation steps described above.\n- Add/adjust tests/docs as needed; keep coverage at 100%.\n- Ensure make targets pass: make test; make coverage; make build.\n","acceptance_criteria":"Implement remediation; keep CI/coverage green","notes":"Replaced retired make coverage-enforce with make coverage.","status":"open","priority":0,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-19T21:26:15.829784525Z","updated_at":"2025-12-21T15:43:54.943959366Z","labels":["audit","blocker"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"mmm-63.3","depends_on_id":"mmm-63","type":"parent-child","created_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","created_by":""},{"issue_id":"mmm-63.3","depends_on_id":"mmm-63","type":"discovered-from","created_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","created_by":""}]}

The issue is not \"having overrides\" by itself; it is the combination of:\n\n1) The binary auto-loads `.env` at runtime from the current working directory, and\n2) The HTTP clients allow overriding the API base URL via env vars, and\n3) Those clients always attach auth headers (your embedded keys) to requests.\n\nEvidence:\n\n- Runtime `.env` autoload: `main.go:12` imports `github.com/joho/godotenv/autoload`.\n- Modrinth base URL override: `internal/modrinth/modrinthClient.go:39` reads `MODRINTH_API_URL`.\n- CurseForge base URL override: `internal/curseforge/curseforgeClient.go:37` reads `CURSEFORGE_API_URL`.\n- Auth headers are unconditionally added:\n  - Modrinth: `internal/modrinth/modrinthClient.go:26`\n  - CurseForge: `internal/curseforge/curseforgeClient.go:25`\n\nExploit scenario:\n\n- If a user runs `mmm` in a folder containing a malicious `.env` (for example, shipped inside a modpack zip or a repo checkout), that `.env` can set `MODRINTH_API_URL` / `CURSEFORGE_API_URL` to an attacker-controlled host.\n- The binary will then send the embedded API keys to that host via `Authorization` / `x-api-key`.\n\nImpact:\n\n- Leaks embedded API keys.\n- Keys are intended to be embedded, but that does not make exfiltration acceptable; it broadens the exposure surface and makes accidental leakage easier and harder to detect.\n\nRemediation:\n\n- Remove production support for env-driven API base URL overrides entirely (per maintainer decision).\n- Replace test usage of `MODRINTH_API_URL` / `CURSEFORGE_API_URL` with an explicit test hook:\n  - either a `SetBaseURLForTesting(...) func() restore` pattern in each package, or\n  - a build-time injected default (for example `-ldflags -X ...`) used only in test binaries.\n- Also reject empty base URLs defensively; today `internal/curseforge/curseforgeClient.go:39-41` returns an empty string when the env var is set to empty.\n- Maintain runtime `.env` support for user-supplied keys (per maintainer decision) loaded from CWD, but do not allow `.env` to affect network destinations; use an allowlist-based loader (only import known MMM env vars) rather than `godotenv/autoload` loading everything from the current directory.\n\nConfidence: High.\n\n\n# Acceptance criteria\n\n- Implement all remediation steps described above.\n- Add/adjust tests/docs as needed; keep coverage at 100%.\n- Ensure make targets pass: make test; make coverage-enforce; make build.\n","acceptance_criteria":"Implement remediation; keep CI/coverage green","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-19T21:28:06.929036723Z","updated_at":"2025-12-19T23:13:25.991323755Z","closed_at":"2025-12-19T23:13:25.991323755Z","labels":["audit","critical"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"mmm-63.6","depends_on_id":"mmm-63","type":"parent-child","created_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","created_by":""},{"issue_id":"mmm-63.6","depends_on_id":"mmm-63","type":"discovered-from","created_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","created_by":""}]}

not fully auditable beyond manual review.\n- Small Surfaces: FAIL\n  - Unnecessary exported helpers/types in tests (`mmm-63.80`); exported APIs missing docs (`mmm-63.78`).\n\n### Explicitness\n\n- Visible Dependencies: FAIL\n  - Global state patterns (i18n/perf/telemetry/minecraft cache) (`mmm-63.19`, `mmm-63.20`, `mmm-63.34`, `mmm-63.94`).\n- Visible Configuration: FAIL\n  - Security/operability risks around `.env` and runtime configuration (`mmm-63.6`, `mmm-63.7`).\n- Visible State: FAIL\n  - Global caches/state (same tickets as Visible Dependencies).\n- Visible Assumptions: FAIL\n  - Ignored errors and fail-open logic (`mmm-63.68`, `mmm-63.81`, `mmm-63.88`).\n\n### Interface Design\n\n- Consistent APIs: FAIL\n  - Inconsistent error wrapping strategy (`mmm-63.69`); URL construction/escaping gaps (`mmm-63.85`).\n- Versioned Contracts: N/A\n  - This is a single CLI binary repo (not a published library); no external API versioning scheme is defined.\n- Backward Compatibility: PARTIAL\n  - CLI behavior stability is important but not formally specified/enforced at a contract level; doc mismatch is tracked (`mmm-63.3`).\n\n## Correctness\n\n### Design for Testability\n\n- Single Responsibility: FAIL\n  - Large, multi-concern command code (`mmm-63.60`); oversized functions list (`mmm-63.95`).\n- Composition Over Inheritance: PASS\n  - Go codebase; no inheritance hierarchies observed.\n- Injectable Dependencies: PARTIAL\n  - Many commands use deps structs; however global state remains significant (`mmm-63.19`, `mmm-63.20`, `mmm-63.34`).\n\n### Predictability\n\n- Deterministic Behavior: PARTIAL\n  - No production `time.Now()`/`rand` usage found via `rg` scans above.\n  - Determinism still threatened by concurrency races (`mmm-63.1`, `mmm-63.19`, `mmm-63.20`).\n- No Hidden Nondeterminism: PARTIAL\n  - Same as above.\n\n### Testing Philosophy\n\n- Tests Map to Behavior: PARTIAL\n  - 100% coverage exists, but mapping is not explicitly indexed per behavior.\n- Tests Precede Implementation: N/A\n  - Historical process; cannot be verified from static repo state.\n- Tests Cover Failure Cases: PARTIAL\n  - Some failure cases are covered, but multiple fail-open behaviors exist (`mmm-63.81`, `mmm-63.90`).\n\n### Testing Practice\n\n- Tests Exercise Real Code: PARTIAL\n  - Many tests run production paths; no formal rule/enforcement in CI.\n- Tests Are Deterministic: FAIL\n  - `time.Sleep` usage in tests (`mmm-63.79`).\n- Tests Are Fast: PARTIAL\n  - No systematic runtime budget enforcement; `time.Sleep` is a direct speed smell (`mmm-63.79`).\n- Tests Are Never Hidden: FAIL\n  - `t.Skip*` usage exists (`mmm-63.83`).\n\n## Reliability\n\n### Error Handling\n\n- Explicit Error Paths: PARTIAL\n  - Some errors are wrapped/propagated; others are ignored or collapsed.\n- Loud Failures: FAIL\n  - Silent panic swallowing (`mmm-63.89`), ignored errors (`mmm-63.68`, `mmm-63.96`), misleading Must semantics (`mmm-63.93`).\n- Boundary Validation: FAIL\n  - Path traversal / filename safety issues (`mmm-63.9`), URL escaping/validation gaps (`mmm-63.85`), version parsing that ignores invalid input (`mmm-63.98`).\n- Designed Recovery: FAIL\n  - Retry/cancellation/body-safety gaps (`mmm-63.16`, `mmm-63.18`, `mmm-63.22`).\n\n### Resource Management\n\n- Acquire-Release Discipline: FAIL\n  - Downloader/atomic write/symlink safety issues (`mmm-63.8`, `mmm-63.11`, `mmm-63.96`).\n- Scoped Lifetimes: PARTIAL\n  - Some `defer Close()` present; multiple shutdown paths still unbounded.\n- Bounded Resource Usage: FAIL\n  - Unbounded goroutine fan-out (`mmm-63.84`); shutdown can hang (`mmm-63.86`, `mmm-63.34`, `mmm-63.94`).\n\n### Resilience Patterns\n\n- Timeouts on External Calls: PARTIAL\n  - Per-request timeouts are in place in some paths (`internal/httpClient.WithMetadataTimeout`), but shutdown paths remain unbounded (`mmm-63.34`, `mmm-63.94`).\n- Circuit Breakers: N/A\n  - Short-lived CLI commands; circuit breaker semantics are not clearly meaningful beyond retry/timeouts.\n- Bulkheads: N/A\n  - Same rationale as circuit breakers.\n- Graceful Degradation: PARTIAL\n  - Some commands attempt to proceed under partial failure; some fail-open behaviors are risky (`mmm-63.81`).\n- Idempotent Operations: PARTIAL\n  - Update/install workflows include non-idempotent file writes; integrity checks are tracked (`mmm-63.13`).\n\n### Concurrency\n\n- Thread-Safe Patterns: FAIL\n  - Race detector failures (`mmm-63.1`); global state and caches (`mmm-63.19`, `mmm-63.20`).\n- Documented Concurrency Constraints: FAIL\n  - No explicit, enforced concurrency contract; issues exist in practice (`mmm-63.84`).\n\n### Data Integrity\n\n- Reversible Migrations: N/A\n  - No schema migrations in this CLI.\n- Protected Invariants: FAIL\n  - Download integrity and validation gaps (`mmm-63.13`, `mmm-63.81`).\n\n## Operability\n\n### Observability\n\n- Structured Telemetry: FAIL\n  - Logs are unstructured and write failures are ignored (`mmm-63.97`); telemetry shutdown/privacy also has open findings (`mmm-63.34`, `mmm-63.35`).\n- Traceable Requests: PARTIAL\n  - Perf spans exist; nil-context handling and shutdown concerns remain (`mmm-63.92`, `mmm-63.94`).\n- Informative Errors: PARTIAL\n  - i18n coverage exists; error-wrapping inconsistency remains (`mmm-63.69`).\n\n### Startup and Shutdown\n\n- Configuration Validation at Startup: PARTIAL\n  - Some validation exists; docs/behavior mismatch is tracked (`mmm-63.3`).\n- Graceful Shutdown: FAIL\n  - Shutdown can hang / lacks forced-exit policy (`mmm-63.86`, `mmm-63.34`, `mmm-63.94`).\n\n### Health Exposure\n\n- Health Checks: N/A\n  - CLI tool; no long-running service endpoints.\n- Dependency Health: N/A\n  - Same rationale.\n\n## Efficiency\n\n- No Needless Waste: PARTIAL\n  - No systematic profiling baseline; perf tooling exists but correctness/robustness issues remain (`mmm-63.92`).\n- Appropriate Data Structures: PARTIAL\n  - Not formally audited; no automated enforcement.\n- Lazy Computation: PARTIAL\n  - Not formally audited.\n\n## Maintainability\n\n### Structural Qualities\n\n- Small Units: FAIL\n  - Function-size scan results and refactor ticket (`mmm-63.95`); large command files (`mmm-63.60`).\n- High Cohesion: FAIL\n  - Mixed concerns in command packages (`mmm-63.60`).\n- Loose Coupling: PARTIAL\n  - Some dependency injection exists; global state reduces isolation (`mmm-63.19`, `mmm-63.20`).\n- Localized Changes: FAIL\n  - Large files/functions increase blast radius (`mmm-63.60`, `mmm-63.95`).\n- Incremental Evolution: PARTIAL\n  - Many changes are possible, but large units make small steps harder.\n\n### Debt Management\n\n- Visible Debt: PASS\n  - No TODO/FIXME/HACK markers found in Go sources via `rg` scan above.\n- Scoped Refactoring: PARTIAL\n  - Multiple broad refactors are implied by findings; not yet scoped into small steps.\n\n## Safety\n\n### Security\n\n- No Embedded Secrets: PARTIAL\n  - No obvious hardcoded real secrets found in Go sources (placeholders exist), but broader credential and config risks are tracked (`mmm-63.6`).\n- Input Sanitization: FAIL\n  - Path traversal / unsafe filename handling (`mmm-63.9`); URL escaping/validation (`mmm-63.85`).\n- Minimal Privilege: PARTIAL\n  - CLI writes to disk; sandboxing and boundary safety are tracked (`mmm-63.10`).\n\n### Privacy\n\n- Data Minimization: PARTIAL\n  - Telemetry exists; anonymization claim mismatch (`mmm-63.35`).\n- Controlled Access: PARTIAL\n  - Not a service; telemetry and logging posture still has open work.\n\n### Inclusivity\n\n- Accessible Interfaces: PARTIAL\n  - TUI exists; locale issues exist (`mmm-63.38`).\n- Inclusive Language: FAIL\n  - User-facing strings bypass i18n and include emoji (`mmm-63.66`).\n\n## Consistency\n\n### Project Standards\n\n- Style Conformance: PASS\n  - `gofmt` scan shows `0` unformatted Go files.\n- Idiomatic Patterns: PARTIAL\n  - Some non-idiomatic naming patterns exist (`mmm-63.75`, `mmm-63.77`).\n\n### Automated Enforcement\n\n- Static Analysis: FAIL\n  - Staticcheck violations exist and are not enforced cleanly (`mmm-63.76`); repo-wide lint gate via golangci-lint is missing (`mmm-63.99`).\n- Security Scanning: FAIL\n  - Toolchain vulnerability posture and govulncheck findings are tracked (`mmm-63.31`, `mmm-63.32`); gosec CI security scanning gate is missing (`mmm-63.100`).\n\n# Index maintenance\n\nNet-new second-pass tickets that extend CodeQuality coverage beyond the first audit:\n\n- `mmm-63.75`, `mmm-63.76`, `mmm-63.77`, `mmm-63.78`, `mmm-63.79`, `mmm-63.80`, `mmm-63.81`, `mmm-63.83`, `mmm-63.84`, `mmm-63.85`, `mmm-63.86`, `mmm-63.87`, `mmm-63.88`, `mmm-63.89`, `mmm-63.90`, `mmm-63.91`, `mmm-63.92`, `mmm-63.93`, `mmm-63.94`, `mmm-63.95`, `mmm-63.96`, `mmm-63.97`, `mmm-63.98`, `mmm-63.99`, `mmm-63.100`.\n\n","acceptance_criteria":"Implement remediation;
